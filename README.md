Actor-Critic (ADP) Reinforcement Learning Model

This project implements an Actor-Critic reinforcement learning algorithm using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). The notebook demonstrates how an agent learns optimal policies by combining policy-based (actor) and value-based (critic) methods.

📌 Features

Implementation of the Actor-Critic algorithm

Step-by-step explanation with code and outputs

Training an agent in a simulated environment

Visualization of rewards and learning progress

Clear structure for educational purposes
